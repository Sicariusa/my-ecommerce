# Builder AI Enhancement - Cleanup Summary

## What Was Removed

Since the builder now uses direct Google Gemini API integration instead of Chef backend, the following Chef-related files and changes have been removed:

### Files Deleted
1. `chatbot/chef-agent/tools/enhanceBuilderProject.ts` - Chef tool definition
2. `BUILDER_CHEF_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Chef integration documentation
3. `BUILDER_INTEGRATION_SETUP.md` - Chef setup guide

### Code Changes Reverted

#### `chatbot/chef-agent/constants.ts`
- ❌ Removed "Enhance Website Builder Project" suggestion
- ❌ Removed builder-related prewarm paths (`builder/project.json`, `builder/components`)

#### `chatbot/chef-agent/prompts/solutionConstraints.ts`
- ❌ Removed entire `<builder_integration>` section (135+ lines)
- ❌ Removed component type documentation
- ❌ Removed enhancement rules and patterns
- ❌ Removed example component defaults

## What Remains (Working Implementation)

### Core Files
1. `platform/client/app/api/builder/enhance/route.ts` - **Google Gemini API integration**
2. `platform/client/components/builder/EnhanceWithAI.tsx` - **UI component**
3. `platform/client/components/builder/BuilderTopBar.tsx` - **Button with loading state**

### Dependencies
- `@google/generative-ai` - Google AI SDK
- No Chef dependencies required

### Environment Variables
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Your Google AI API key

## Current Architecture

```
User clicks "Enhance with AI" 
    ↓
EnhanceWithAI component opens modal
    ↓
User enters enhancement prompt
    ↓
Frontend calls /api/builder/enhance
    ↓
API route calls Google Gemini 2.5 Pro
    ↓
AI returns enhanced project JSON
    ↓
Builder updates with enhanced project
    ↓
User sees changes with undo/redo support
```

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Simpler Setup**: No Chef backend required
✅ **Direct Integration**: Calls Google AI directly
✅ **Faster Response**: No intermediate Chef processing
✅ **Lower Complexity**: Fewer moving parts
✅ **Cost Effective**: Uses Google's generous free tier
✅ **Reliable**: No dependency on Chef authentication

## Next Steps

1. Add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to `platform/client/.env.local`
2. Run `npm run dev` in `platform/client`
3. Test the "Enhance with AI" feature
4. Enjoy AI-powered website building! 🚀

The integration is now clean, simple, and fully functional with Google Gemini AI.
