# Quick Start Guide - Builder with AI Enhancement

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to use the "Enhance with AI" feature in the website builder:

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js (v18 or higher)
2. pnpm (for Chef backend)
3. A Convex account (free at https://convex.dev)
4. An Anthropic API key (or OpenAI, Google, etc.)

## Step 1: Start the Chef AI Backend

The Chef AI agent must be running for enhancement to work.

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Chef Backend
cd chatbot
pnpm install  # Only needed first time

# Create .env.local with your API keys
echo 'VITE_CONVEX_URL=placeholder' >> .env.local
echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here' >> .env.local

# Start the frontend
pnpm run dev
```

This starts the Chef AI agent on **http://localhost:5173** or **http://127.0.0.1:5173**

## Step 2: Start Convex (Required for Chef)

```bash
# Terminal 2 - Convex Backend  
cd chatbot
npx convex dev
```

**First time setup**: Follow the prompts to:
- Create a Convex project
- Link it to your account
- This will update your `.env.local` with the correct `VITE_CONVEX_URL`

## Step 3: Set up Chef Authentication

You need to sign into Chef before the builder can use it:

1. Open **http://127.0.0.1:5173** in your browser (use 127.0.0.1, not localhost)
2. Sign in with your Convex account
3. Keep this tab open (Chef session needed for API calls)

## Step 4: Start the Platform/Builder

```bash
# Terminal 3 - Website Builder
cd platform/client
npm install  # Only needed first time
npm run dev
```

This starts the builder on **http://localhost:3000**

## Step 4: Use the Enhancement Feature

1. Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser
2. Navigate to the website builder
3. Create or open a project
4. Click the **"Enhance with AI"** button (gradient purple-pink, sparkles icon ‚ú®)
5. Enter your enhancement request or select an example:
   - "Add a contact form section with name, email, and message fields"
   - "Make the design more modern with better spacing and colors"
   - "Add a features section with 3 columns showcasing key benefits"
   - And more...
6. Click **"Enhance Project"**
7. Wait for the AI to process (usually 5-30 seconds)
8. Your project will be updated automatically!

## ‚úÖ What Works

- ‚ú® AI-powered enhancements to your website
- üìù Natural language requests
- üé® Design improvements
- üîß Component additions
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è Undo/redo support
- üíæ Auto-save after enhancement

## üîß Configuration (Optional)

If you need to change the Chef API URL:

```bash
# In /workspace/platform/client/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHEF_API_URL=http://localhost:5173/api/chat
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Enhancement button doesn't respond
- **Check**: Is Chef backend running on port 5173?
- **Check**: Is Convex backend running?
- **Check**: Browser console for errors (F12)

### "Failed to enhance project" error
- **Check**: Chef backend logs in Terminal 1
- **Check**: API key is configured (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
- **Check**: Your prompt is clear and specific

### API keys not working
Add API keys to `/workspace/chatbot/.env.local`:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

## üìö Example Enhancement Requests

### Add New Sections
- "Add a testimonials section with 3 customer reviews"
- "Create a pricing section with 3 tiers: Basic, Pro, Enterprise"
- "Add a FAQ section with 5 common questions"

### Improve Design
- "Make the hero section more modern with better typography"
- "Improve spacing and use a consistent color scheme"
- "Add smooth animations to the buttons"

### Add Interactive Elements
- "Add a contact form with name, email, phone, and message"
- "Create a newsletter signup form"
- "Add a search bar in the header"

## üéØ Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: "Add a contact form with name, email, and message fields" is better than "improve the page"
2. **One Thing at a Time**: Make incremental changes rather than requesting everything at once
3. **Use Examples**: The 6 pre-configured examples are tested and work well
4. **Review Changes**: Always review what the AI added before saving
5. **Use Undo**: If you don't like a change, just press Ctrl+Z (or use the undo button)

## üîí Security Note

Your project data is sent to the Chef AI agent for processing. In this local setup:
- Data stays on your machine
- Chef runs locally (not in the cloud)
- API keys are stored in local environment variables

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the enhancement feature:
- Try combining multiple enhancements
- Export your projects as Next.js apps
- Deploy to staging/production environments
